# XP-Pen Simple Whiteboard App Specification

## Overview

I'd like to make this tablet be much simpler to use.

I use it for primarily whiteboard sketching. I just need the tablet to act like a simple whiteboard like using a single black marker.

## Core Requirements

### Drawing Functionality

- **Single Tool Mode**: Only black marker/pen tool available
- **Pressure Sensitivity**: Pen pressure affects line thickness (thicker lines with more pressure)
- **Smooth Drawing**: Real-time drawing with minimal latency
- **Natural Feel**: Drawing should feel as natural as using a physical marker on a whiteboard

### User Interface

- **Minimal UI**: Clean, distraction-free interface
- **Full Canvas**: Maximum drawing area with minimal UI elements
- **No Tool Palette**: No need for color pickers, brush selection, or complex tools
- **Simple Controls**: Only essential controls visible

### Essential Features

- **Clear Canvas**: Single button/shortcut to clear the entire canvas
- **Save Drawing**: Ability to save the current drawing to a file
- **Canvas Size**: Full-screen drawing area that utilizes the entire tablet surface
- **Pen Only**: No mouse/touch input - designed specifically for pen input

### Technical Requirements

- **Cross-Platform**: Should work on macOS, Windows, and Linux
- **Low Resource Usage**: Lightweight application that doesn't consume excessive CPU/memory
- **Quick Startup**: App should launch quickly for immediate use
- **XP-Pen Compatibility**: Optimized for XP-Pen tablet drivers and pressure sensitivity

### Nice-to-Have Features

- **Auto-save**: Automatically save work periodically
- **Recent Files**: Quick access to recently saved drawings
- **Export Options**: Save as PNG, JPG, or PDF
- **Undo/Redo**: Basic undo functionality (Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y)

### What to Avoid

- Complex menus and toolbars
- Multiple brush types or colors
- Layer management
- Advanced drawing features
- Complicated file management
- Social sharing features

## Success Criteria

The app is successful if:

1. A user can start drawing immediately after launching
2. The drawing experience feels natural and responsive
3. The interface doesn't get in the way of creativity
4. Saving and clearing the canvas is intuitive
5. The app launches quickly and runs smoothly
