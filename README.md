This is the software for the XP-Pen Star G640 graphics tablet! This is a popular USB drawing tablet, and there are definitely opportunities to improve the user experience beyond what the standard drivers provide.

To give you the most relevant guidance, I'd like to understand your goals better:

**What specific aspects would you like to simplify?**
- Custom button/hotkey mapping?
- Pressure sensitivity fine-tuning?
- Application-specific profiles?
- Gesture recognition?
- Calibration and mapping tools?
- Alternative driver with better performance?

**Technical considerations:**
- What operating system(s) are you targeting? macOS
- What's your preferred programming language/framework? Go
- Are you looking to replace the existing drivers entirely, or create companion software? replace entirely, but simplify the things that the tablet can do.

**Common approaches for tablet software:**
1. **HID (Human Interface Device) communication** - Direct USB communication with the tablet
2. **Driver wrapper/enhancement** - Working alongside existing drivers
3. **Configuration utility** - GUI for advanced settings and profiles
4. **Middleware layer** - Intercepting and processing tablet input before sending to applications

The Star G640 uses standard HID protocols, so it's definitely possible to create custom software for it. I can help you with the architecture, code examples, and implementation strategies once I understand your specific use case better.

What's your main frustration with the current XP-Pen software that you'd like to solve?
